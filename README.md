# Mud from the Couch

A mud client that allows you to play multi user dungeons (text based games) using an xbox controller!

# Introduction

mud-from-the-couch intends to transform text based adventures into an activity that can be conducted from a couch.

It allows the user to bind specific commands to xbox gamepad buttons. Specific words can be binded as targets using a selector menu controlled by the gamepad analog stick.

The client allows the user to load a Clojure file to be evaluated  allowing the client to be modified at run time with the full power of a programming language.
